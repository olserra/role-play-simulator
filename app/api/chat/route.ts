    Cerepro® is a neuroprotective drug that comes in capsule form, with its active ingredient being INN choline alfoscerate. The drug is available in dosages of 400 mg, with packaging options of 28 and 56 capsules. Cerepro® operates with a unique triple mechanism of action that aims to restore the structure, metabolism, and functions of neurons. This makes it particularly suitable for patients suffering from acute and chronic cerebrovascular diseases which manifest as cognitive and motor impairments. The drug achieves its effects primarily through choline, which improves the transmission of nerve impulses in neurons; glycerophosphate, which transforms to phosphatidylcholine to repair damaged neuronal membranes; and a metabolotropic action which protects living cells from damage. Indications for Cerepro® use include cerebral circulatory disorders of ischemic type (both acute and recovery periods) and hemorrhagic type during the recovery phase. It's also recommended for patients exhibiting psycho-organic syndrome due to involutional and degenerative processes of the brain. Additionally, elderly individuals suffering from cerebrovascular insufficiency or those showing primary and secondary cognitive impairments characterized by memory issues, confusion, decreased motivation and initiative, reduced attention span, and other behavioral and affective disorders, can benefit from this medication. Emotional instability, heightened irritability, decreased interest, and conditions like senile pseudomelancholia and multi-infarct dementia are also indications for its use. However, there are some contraindications to be aware of. The drug shouldn't be administered to those with hypersensitivity to its components, pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers, and children under 18 years, due to insufficient data on its effects. The prescribed dosage is one 400 mg capsule taken 2-3 times daily, though the exact duration of treatment should be determined by a doctor based on the individual's clinical picture and disease progression. The shelf life of Cerepro® is 2 years.
    The competitive landscape for Cerepro®, a product of Veropharm, is characterized by a few notable competitors including Mexidol from PHARMASOFT, Ceraxon by Takeda, and Actovegin under Nicomedes/Takeda. Cerepro® has a primary composition of Choline alfoscerate and falls under the nootropic drug category. Its pharmacological actions emphasize membrane-stabilizing properties, improving synaptic transmission, a neurotransmitter effect due to acetylcholine synthesis, and enhancing metabolic processes. By addressing the pathogenetic changes in ischemia and degeneration, Cerepro® effectively repairs damaged nerve cells and safeguards living cells. It also plays a role as a donor of ACh and phospholipids, strengthening membrane elasticity and resilience. This results in improved memory and cognitive functions in just a month, providing an optimal tolerance profile and limited drug interactions.
    Mexidol, on the other hand, is composed of Ethylmethylhydroxypyridine succinate and is categorized as an antioxidant agent. It serves as a membrane protector and exhibits antihypoxic, antioxidant, nootropic, anticonvulsant, and anxiolytic actions. Its primary role as an antioxidant agent protects living cells under hypoxic conditions. Mexidol facilitates an increase in the level of ACh in damaged cells while inhibiting acetylcholine. It's often utilized in complex therapies, although it's contraindicated in patients with acute liver disease and renal insufficiency.
    Ceraxon contains Citicoline and is also a nootropic drug. Its main pharmacological function is membrane stabilization and it demonstrates a neurotransmitter effect due to the synthesis of acetylcholine. However, Ceraxon has a restricted range of release forms. The activation of its active ingredient, Citicoline, demands a sequence of biochemical transformations which can potentially affect the speed of therapeutic effects, especially in older patients.
    Lastly, Actovegin, a product derived from deproteinized calf blood hemoderivate, is primarily a stimulator of tissue regeneration. Its action encompasses antihypoxant properties, metabolic, neuroprotective, and microcirculatory effects. It's noteworthy that Actovegin presents a risk of allergic reactions, and thus, a trial injection (hypersensitivity test) is recommended before widespread use. The exact mechanism of Actovegin is intricate as it consists of over two hundred biological components, making it challenging to identify the primary active substance.
    Cerepro®: Competitive Landscape
    Cerepro® (Veropharm)
    Evidentiary basis:
    Cerepro® is included in the standards of care for a wide range of CNS, which encompasses ailments such as Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarction, and multiple sclerosis. Results from numerous clinical trials have unequivocally demonstrated the efficacy of choline alphoscerate in enhancing motor activity and cognitive functions in patients suffering from both acute and chronic cerebrovascular diseases. A significant highlight of Cerepro® is its neuroprotective quality. This neuroprotective effect was sustained up to 3 months following the conclusion of the therapeutic course, thereby diminishing the risk of IP progression.
    Mexidol (PHARMASOFT)
    The injectable form of Mexidol contains sodium metabisulfite, an ingredient which is recognized as a potent allergen and can provoke anaphylaxis. An in-depth analysis of studies that examined the utilization of preparations containing EMGPS revealed a concerning trend: there's a conspicuous absence of convincing evidence advocating for the use of these preparations in clinical practice. A significant portion of the studies that were examined had either a small sample size or were plagued with unsatisfactory characterizations of the treatment methods. The studies also exhibited clear flaws in their methodology or the conclusions they drew were insubstantial or dubious.
    Ceraxon (Takeda)
    Unlike Cerepro®, Ceraxon boasts a broader range of indications within its spectrum, particularly for use in cases involving psycho-organic syndrome against the backdrop of degenerative and involutional changes in the brain. It's also recommended for treating the consequences of cerebrovascular insufficiency. Notable behavioral changes as a result of its use include pseudomelancholia, as well as several shifts in the emotional realm, such as increased emotional lability, irritability, and a noticeable decline in interest.
    Actovegin (Nicomed/Takeda)
    The mechanisms by which Actovegin exerts its therapeutic effect on neuropathic symptoms remain enigmatic. Conventional pharmacokinetic methods prove unsuitable when attempting to discern the impact on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the drug. A distinctive feature of Actovegin, unlike Cerepro®, is its exclusive use for symptomatic treatment. Some potential issues associated with Actovegin are painful intramuscular injections, the risk of tissue necrosis at the injection site if the volume or rate of the injection exceeds the recommended limit, making the solution hypertonic. Actovegin's large molecular constituents, which approximate around 5KDa, elicit doubts regarding their efficient passage through the bilipid layer, particularly the molecules that weigh between 900-5000Da. In a research study conducted by Artemis Research in 2017 involving 503 patients, by the third month, the placebo group displayed no statistically significant difference compared to the Actovegin group, necessitating additional controlled research.
